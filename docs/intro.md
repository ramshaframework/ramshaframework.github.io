# Intro

### What is Ramsha Framework?

**Ramsha Framework** is a lightweight, modular backend framework designed to help developers build scalable and maintainable applications with a clear and organized architecture.

It focuses on:

* Clean project structure
* Separation of concerns
* Developer productivity
* Flexibility without unnecessary complexity

Ramsha is ideal for developers who want **full control over their backend logic** while keeping the codebase easy to understand and extend.

### Why Ramsha Framework?

Many frameworks are either:

* Too minimal (forcing you to build everything from scratch), or
* Too heavy (adding complexity you don’t always need)

Ramsha Framework is designed to sit in the middle by providing:

* A **solid foundation** for backend development
* A **clear architectural pattern**
* Freedom to customize and extend as your project grows
